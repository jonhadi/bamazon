# Bamazon
This app I made allows the user to make an account, post or buy items.

To accomplish this, Bamazon utilizes Nodejs and the following node modules: mysql to utilize a local database and inquirer for console UI.

## NEXT TO IMPLEMENT:
User Login
- Having issues with asynchronous code and waiting for log in check
Track best selling department
- Bamazon has departments avaliable, but does not currently keep track of gross sales of each department

## TO USE:
User will need to install Nodejs and the listed modules above.
User also will need their own MySQL WorkBench to host a local database

## HOW TO USE:
In your console window go the directory the files this repo is located in
 - these are the four commands you can type into the console:

"node bamazon.js"
 - this command starts the program
